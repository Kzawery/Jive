# Business Support Chatbot Project Brief for AI Teams

## Project Overview

We need to develop an AI-powered customer support chatbot specifically for business websites that provides product information, service details, installation instructions, and general problem-solving. The system must be able to process PDF documentation, learn from user interactions, allow human oversight, and include security measures against jailbreaking attempts.

## Key Requirements

1. **Document Understanding**: Process and understand PDF documentation about products and services
2. **Conversation Learning**: Learn from previous user interactions to improve responses
3. **Human Oversight**: Allow support team members to view, intervene in, and annotate conversations
4. **Security Measures**: Implement protections against prompt injection and jailbreak attempts
5. **Feedback Integration**: Support annotation of completed conversations to improve future responses

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion & Knowledge Base

- **PDF Processing Pipeline**
  - Document ingestion system for company PDFs (product manuals, guides, etc.)
  - Text extraction and preprocessing
  - Document chunking and semantic indexing
  - Vector embeddings creation for semantic search
  
- **Knowledge Storage**
  - Vector database for semantic search capabilities
  - Metadata tagging system for document sections
  - Version control for documentation updates
  
- **Preferred Tools**:
  - Vector Database: Pinecone or Weaviate (COMMENT: final selection depends on scaling needs and budget)
  - PDF Processing: LangChain document loaders + PyPDF2 or Azure Form Recognizer for complex documents
  - Embedding Generation: OpenAI Embeddings API or SentenceTransformers (COMMENT: choose based on budget constraints)

### 2. Conversational AI System

- **Core Components**
  - Query understanding module
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
  - Context management for conversation history
  - Response generation with citation capabilities
  - Security validation layer

- **Processing Flow**
  1. User submits question
  2. System retrieves relevant document sections from vector DB
  3. Conversation history + retrieved context fed to LLM
  4. Response generated with citations to source documents
  5. Security validation before sending to user

- **Preferred Tools**:
  - Framework: LangChain or LlamaIndex for RAG implementation
  - LLM Provider: OpenAI GPT-4o or Anthropic Claude (COMMENT: selection should consider cost vs. performance tradeoffs)
  - Memory Management: Custom implementation with Redis or similar for session state

### 3. Learning & Feedback System

- **Conversation Database**
  - Storage for complete conversation histories
  - User feedback and ratings
  - Support team annotations and comments
  - Learning points extraction

- **Continuous Improvement Cycle**
  1. Store all conversations with metadata
  2. Support team reviews and annotates completed conversations
  3. System extracts learning points
  4. Regular updates to knowledge base and response patterns
  5. Periodic model fine-tuning based on collected data

- **Preferred Tools**:
  - Database: MongoDB for conversation storage
  - Analytics: Custom dashboard with Metabase or similar
  - Learning Pipeline: Custom ETL process with scheduled jobs

### 4. User Interfaces

- **Customer-Facing Chat Widget**
  - Responsive web component for embedding in business sites
  - File upload capabilities
  - Feedback collection
  - Seamless handoff to human support when needed

- **Support Team Dashboard**
  - Real-time conversation list view with filtering options
  - Conversation detail view with intervention capabilities
  - Notification system for conversations needing attention
  - Annotation and feedback interface for completed conversations
  - Performance analytics and reporting

- **Preferred Tools**:
  - Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
  - Real-time: Socket.io or WebSockets
  - UI Framework: Shadcn/UI or Material UI (COMMENT: select based on design requirements)

### 5. Security Implementation

- **Protection Mechanisms**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Prompt injection detection
  - Pattern matching for jailbreak attempts
  - Rate limiting and abuse prevention
  - Content moderation for sensitive information

- **Monitoring & Alerts**
  - Logging of unusual interaction patterns
  - Alerting system for potential security breaches
  - Regular security pattern updates

- **Preferred Tools**:
  - Input Validation: Custom rules + regex patterns
  - Monitoring: ELK stack or similar logging system
  - Rate Limiting: Redis-based implementation

## Backend Technology Stack

- **API Layer**: FastAPI or Django REST Framework (COMMENT: FastAPI preferred for performance, Django for rapid development with admin interfaces)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data + MongoDB for conversation storage
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or Weaviate
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and rate limiting
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven architecture
- **Deployment**: Docker containers + Kubernetes orchestration
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Azure, or GCP (COMMENT: selection depends on existing infrastructure and team expertise)

## Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React.js or Vue.js
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with component library
- **Build Tools**: Vite or Next.js

## Integration Points

- **Existing Systems**
  - CRM integration for customer context
  - Product database for up-to-date information
  - Support ticketing system for escalations
  - Authentication system for employee access

- **API Endpoints Required**
  - `/api/chat` for conversation management
  - `/api/documents` for knowledge base management
  - `/api/feedback` for collecting ratings and comments
  - `/api/admin` for dashboard functionality

## Decision Points

1. **LLM Provider Selection**: Balance between performance and cost
2. **Vector Database Choice**: Consider scaling needs and integration complexity
3. **Deployment Strategy**: On-premises vs. cloud considerations
4. **PDF Processing Approach**: Simple extraction vs. advanced structure understanding
5. **Fine-tuning Strategy**: How often to retrain models and with what data
6. **Security Implementation Depth**: Balance between protection and user experience

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core knowledge base and basic chat functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Support team dashboard and intervention capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Learning system and feedback integration
4. **Phase 4**: Security enhancements and performance optimization
5. **Phase 5**: Integration with existing business systems

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of queries successfully answered without human intervention
- Average time to resolution
- User satisfaction ratings
- Support team efficiency improvement
- Knowledge gap identification rate
- System security incident frequency
