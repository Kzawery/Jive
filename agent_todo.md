Set Approach: 
1. Foundation: RAG-based System with Custom Development
A custom-built Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system:
CopyUser Query → Document Retrieval → LLM Processing → Response Generation
2. Key Components to Implement

Knowledge Base with Multi-modal Support

PDF Processing: Use PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF for extraction, with layout analysis
Image Understanding: Integrate vision models like GPT-4V or CLIP
Vector Database: Implement Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma for semantic search
Chunking Strategy: Develop intelligent document segmentation


Web Browsing Capability

Headless Browser: Playwright or Puppeteer for controlled web navigation
Screenshot Analysis: Vision models to interpret website content
Scraping Framework: Custom extractors for specific websites/data


Task Automation

Action Framework: Define standard operations (check balance, status verification)
Authentication Handling: Secure credential management
Workflow Engine: Sequential steps with decision points and error handling


Security & Integration Layer

API Gateway: Manage access to your agent's capabilities
Authentication: OAuth or custom auth for user verification
Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse and manage resource usage
