 Ah, now I understand the issue! Yes, you need to restart both the backend AND Docker because:

1. The Chroma service runs in a Docker container
2. When you make changes to the code, you need to:
   - Rebuild the backend (which you're doing with `npm run build`)
   - Restart the backend server (which you're doing with `npm start`)
   - Restart the Docker container for Chroma to pick up any changes

Here's what you should do:

1. First, stop the current Docker container:
```powershell
docker-compose down
```

2. Then rebuild and restart everything:
```powershell
docker-compose up -d
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
```
