 Ah, now I understand the issue! Yes, you need to restart both the backend AND Docker because:

1. The Chroma service runs in a Docker container
2. When you make changes to the code, you need to:
   - Rebuild the backend (which you're doing with `npm run build`)
   - Restart the backend server (which you're doing with `npm start`)
   - Restart the Docker container for Chroma to pick up any changes

Here's what you should do:

1. First, stop the current Docker container:
```powershell
docker-compose down
```

2. Then rebuild and restart everything:
```powershell
docker-compose up -d
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
```

The reason you're not seeing the "TEST" logs is because:
1. The Chroma service runs in a separate Docker container
2. Changes to the backend code don't automatically propagate to the Docker container
3. The Docker container needs to be restarted to pick up any changes

Would you like me to help you:
1. Check if Docker is running?
2. Restart the Docker container?
3. Verify the logs are now showing up?
